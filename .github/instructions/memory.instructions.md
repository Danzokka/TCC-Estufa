- **User** `specializes_in` **Especiality** (areas of expertise)
- **User** `knows` **Technology** (skill associations)
- **System** `supports` **AdminAccess** (role-based permissions)
- **Database** `stores` **MediaFiles** (project images and assets)

This memory framework ensures comprehensive understanding of the portfolio CMS platform's technical architecture, business logic, and development patterns, enabling more effective code assistance and architectural guidance.
